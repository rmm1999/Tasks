#Hypothesis: The survivability rate of the eggs of Anolis sagrei lizards will decrease the later it gets in their breeding season
#Data: I have two sources of data with a total of about 1,000 data points
lizard_data <- read.csv("lizard_data.csv")
lizard_data2 <- read.csv("lizard_data2.csv")
#I plan on having a bar graph depicting the survivability based on both of the months the breeding took place(March and July)
